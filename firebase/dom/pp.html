InsightPulse – Real-Time Sales Feedback & Agent Performance Monitor
Objective
Build an internal tool for a Sales Ops Team to track customer feedback, monitor sales agent performance, and perform real-time analytics. The dashboard should sync data to Firebase Realtime DB, cache sessions in localStorage, and offer smart insights using JavaScript HOFs (map, filter, reduce, sort).

Use-Case
Sales agents collect structured feedback from clients post-demo. Team leads log in and track:

Client satisfaction
Agent-specific performance
Department-wise impact
Real-time anomalies or underperformance
Features
1. Dual Role Simulation: Agent vs Lead
On page load, choose role:
Agent (can only submit feedback)
Lead (can view dashboard + analytics)
Role must persist via localStorage and impact conditional rendering
2. Feedback Submission Form (Agent Role)
Fields:

Agent Name
Client Company
Department (dropdown: SaaS, Hardware, Consulting, Other)
Satisfaction Score (1–5)
NPS (Net Promoter Score: -100 to +100)
Comment
Validations:

Mandatory: Agent, Company, Score
NPS must be between -100 to +100
Behavior:

On submit: Store to Firebase
If offline: Store in localStorage and show “offline mode” banner
3. Performance Dashboard (Lead Role)
Render a data table with all feedback entries.

Table Columns:
| Agent   | Company   | Dept       | Score | NPS  | Comment           |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------|------|-------------------|
| Kiran   | FinEdge   | SaaS       | 5     | 80   | Loved the demo     |

Conditional Row Coloring:

Green if Score ≥ 4
Yellow if 2 ≤ Score < 4
Red if Score < 2 or NPS ≤ 0
Sorting:

By Score, NPS (toggle: asc/desc)
Filtering:

By Department and Agent
Searching:

By Company name or Agent name (debounced)
4. Analytics Panel (with HOFs Only)
Above the table, show:

Total Feedback Entries
Average Score (2 decimal places)
Average NPS
Department with Highest Avg Score
Top-performing Agent(s) based on NPS
Agents with ≥3 Low Scores (<3)
All analytics must use only map, filter, reduce, sort. No loops.

5. Data Persistence & Sync
Agent form should auto-save data to localStorage if offline
Lead role should include a Sync Now button to push local entries to Firebase
Real-time updates reflected with Firebase listeners (onValue, etc.)
6. UI/UX
Tabs or toggles for switching between:
Feedback Form
Feedback Table
Analytics
Smart role-based rendering:
If role === agent, hide dashboard
If role === lead, hide submission form
Use color-coded alerts & banners for sync status
